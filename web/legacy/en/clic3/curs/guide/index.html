<P>&nbsp;
<P>The first three modules, which are common to other PIE courses, are organised by a combination of guided practices with an explanation of the course content inserted.
<P>The last four modules are structured as follows:
<P class="ENUM"><B>A.</B> A main document where the module contents are explained.
<P class="ENUM"><B>B.</B> A combination of guided practices explained step by step. We recommended that the proposed order of exercises is followed as the exercises often use materials created in previous exercises.
<P class="ENUM"><B>C.</B> A proposal of exercises to carry out, which you have to do and then send to the course tutor by e-mail.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>At the end of the course you will have to write a project consisting of an activity pack which you will also have to send to the course tutor in order to receive a pass for the course.
<H1>Sending the exercises</H1>
<P>Before sending your materials, they should be compressed in ZIP format (using WinZip or a similar tool).
<P>The materials corresponding to each module's exercises have to be sent together, compressed in a single ZIP file and added to an email message to the course tutor. It is important to include the following information in the message: your name; email address; which module the exercises are from; and a brief description of the contents.
<H1>Necessary programmes</H1>
<P>Although Clic also works with Windows 3.1, the materials for this course have been designed for a multimedia computer equipped with Windows 95, 98, NT o 2000.
<P>You should check that the sound card controllers are properly installed and that the speakers and microphone are connected and working properly.
<P>You will need the following programmes to do the exercises and the guided practices:
<UL>
<LI>The <B>Clic 3.0</B> programme, which can be found on the "Sinera" CD-ROM or downloaded from the The Clic corner.
<LI>A <B>graphics package </B>which allows GIF and BMP formats. We recommend <I>Paint Shop Pro</I>, which can also be downloaded from the resources section of <A HREF="http://www.xtec.cat/recursos/clic">"The Clic corner"</A>.
<LI>A <B>sound editor</B> which allows the recording of different resolutions and wave manipulation. <I>CooolEdit 96</I> could be a good option, this programme can also be downloaded from the resources section of "The Clic corner".
<LI>The <B>WinZip </B>utility, which will let you decompress the exercises that we send you and to compress your exercises so as to save disk space and connection time to the internet.
<LI>You will also have to download and print the <B>manual </B>for Clic version 3.0, which can be found on the "Sinera" CD-ROM and on the information section of <A HREF="http://www.xtec.cat/recursos/clic">"The Clic corner"</A>.
</UL>
<H1>File Organisation</H1>
<P>Before starting the course you should prepare a set of folders to save the exercises files.<P>
Clic is usually installed in the <B>C:\CLIC </B>folder. In this folder you should create another called <B>Course</B>.
<P>Within <B>Course</B> you need to create five more folders called: <B>Module1</B>, <B>Module2</B>, <B>Module3</B>, <B>Module4 </B>and <B>Project</B>.
<P>Within each of the first four folders you need to create two more and call them <B>Practice</B> and <B>Exercice</B>.
<P>The final result should look like this:
<P><IMG SRC="carpetes.gif" WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=274 BORDER=0>
<P>There is a ZIP file at the start of each guided practice which contains the necessary materials to do it. The contents of these ZIP files should be decompressed in the corresponding "Practice" folder for each unit.
<P>There are also ZIP files for some of the exercises, which should be decompressed in the corresponding "Practice" folder for its module.
