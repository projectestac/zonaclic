<A HREF="prac1.zip"><IMG SRC="../disquet.gif" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=39 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT"></A>To do the guided practices for this module you will have to download the <A HREF="prac1.zip">prac1.zip</A> file and decompress its contents in the folder <B>C:\Clic\Course\Module1\Practice</B><P>
<H1>Practice 1<BR>Creating a puzzle from an image</H1>
In this first exercise we will make one of the simplest Clic activities; a puzzle based on an image split into rectangles.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Start up Clic and activate the <B>File - New... - Puzzle</B> menu.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The programme will ask for the working directory that you wish to use. Search for the <B>C:\Clic\Course\Module1\Practice</B> folder and confirm the operation.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Note that there are two options in the <B>Content</B> area of the window: <B>Image</B> or <B>Text</B>. In this exercise we will select the option <B>Image</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Open the list below these two options (where it says NEW IMAGE) and select the <B>AFRICA.GIF</B> file. If the file is not there, it means that you have not correctly selected the working directory or that you have not decompressed the ZIP file as indicated. If this is the case, cancel the operation and start the exercise again from the start.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select the <B>Double</B> mode and choose <B>3</B> rows and <B>3</B> columns.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- In <B>Welcome message</B> write the text:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Order the pieces of this photo of the world<P>
<P CLASS="L">- ... and in <B>Good bye message:</B><P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Very Good!<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the operation by clicking the <B>OK</B> button and check that the activity works.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate  the <B>File - Save</B> menu and save the activity with the name <B>EARTH1.PUZ</B><P>

Now we can make some changes that will help improve the visual aspect of the activity:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate <B>Options - Activity options</B> menu and click on the <B>Solid colour</B> button in the <B>Main window</B> area. Select <B>black</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Do the same with the <B>Game window</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the operation and check the result of the changes.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- To avoid the border line of the game window appearing go back to <B>Activity options</B> and unmark the <B>Shaded frames</B> box. Check how it looks now.<P>
To finish we will make the messages appear in black text on a white background:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity(through the <B>Edit - Edit activity</B> menu, or use the shortcut keys <B>CTRL+E</B>).<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Fonts </B>button.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Mark the <B>Messages</B> box.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Text</B> button and<B> </B>select white. Then change the <B>Background </B>to black. Confirm the operation and check the result of the changes.<P>
Note that the counters have taken the same colours as those selected for the message box.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate the <B>File - Save</B> menu<B> </B>to save the activity again. As we have already given the file a name we will keep it as the same: <B>EARTH1.PUZ</B>.<P>
Before continuing, let us check the function of <B>Compress image</B>: Edit the activity, changing the position to <B>A above B</B> (the third option from the left) and click on <B>OK</B>. You will see that the image is cut off (the bottom part is missing). Edit the activity again and activate the <B>Compress image</B> box. Now the grid dimensions are adjusted to the scale of the original image original, which the programme compresses so that it fits.<P>
Check how the aspect of the activity changes in the <B>Exchange</B>, <B>Hole</B> and <B>Memory</B> modes. You can do this by editing the activity or directly from the main Clic screen, clicking on the <B>Type of puzzle</B> button, which is above the yellow help sign.<P>
Check what happens when the number of rows or columns are changed, and what the <B>Delimit cells </B>option does.<P>
