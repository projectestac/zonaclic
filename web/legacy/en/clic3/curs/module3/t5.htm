<H1>Order words and paragraphs</H1>
As in all the previous cases, to create this type of exercise you have to write a text and select certain words or paragraphs as <B>targets</B>. On starting the activity the targets are shuffled and the student's task is to put them back in order. The reordering is always done by exchanging the positions of a pair of elements, similar to the way that <I>exchange</I> type puzzles are solved.<P>
Obviously, to create one of these exercises at least two targets have to be created; otherwise it would be impossible to disorder anything.<P>
When creating <B>order words</B> type activities, it is possible to limit the initial disordering to <B>paragraph</B> level. In this case the words are only shuffled with their neighbours, making the exercise easier to solve.<P>
The <B>evaluation</B> of order activities is also always <I>deferred</I>.<P>
