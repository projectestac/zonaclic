<H1>Fill in blanks</H1>
</B>The "fill in blanks" type of text activities offer the greatest versatility. The <B>targets</B> can be set out in three different ways:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- As a <B>blank space</B> which has to be filled. These spaces can be initially filled with a variable number of dashes, asterisks, blank spaces, or any other character.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- With an <B>initial</B> <B>expression </B>that the student has to correct.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- As a <B>drop list</B> of options from which one has to be chosen.<P>
In this setting the targets can also have an associated <B>floating help window</B> which can contain a message, sound, image, animation, or any type of multimedia material. These help windows can be activated in three different moments:<P>
<P CLASS="L">a) <B>Automatically</B>, on entering the space.<P>
<P CLASS="L">b) When a wrong answer is written.<P>
<P CLASS="L">c) By pressing <B>F1</B>.<P>
A delay and a maximum time of appearance can also be set.<P>
The <B>evaluation</B> of fill in blanks activities can be <I>immediate</I> or <I>deferred</I>, and in both cases Clic can be made to try to detect which letters or words are wrong and show them by a change in colour. There is also, however, the possibility of just saying whether the answer is correct or not without giving any clues as to where the error may be.<P>
In this type of activity it is recommended to always press the <B>return</B> key (or the <B>forward arrow</B>) after writing the answer in each of the spaces. That way Clic knows you have finished writing and can go on to evaluate the answer.<P>
