<H1>Practice 2<BR>Add help windows to a text activity</H1>
In this exercise we will complete the previous activity by adding some help windows to help the student complete the text.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Open the <B>EDUCA1.TXA</B> activity that you created in the previous exercise. To open an activity you have to go to the <B>File - Open</B> menu, click on the appropriate activity type button on the left (in this case, the text activities button, "aeiou"), look for the folder that where it is saved, select the file and accept.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity with CTRL+E.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Place the cursor within the word "illiterate" and click on the create and edit targets button:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<IMG SRC="botoincognita.gif" WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0 ALT=""><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Pop-up information window</B> box and write:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Person that does not know how to read or write</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Change the size of the information window to <B>180 x 60</B>, activate <B>Centre text</B> and click on the <B>Pop up in errors</B> option.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Accept everything and check what happens when an incorrect answer is written in the first target.<P>
To reinforce the apparition of the help window, we could include a warning sound to get the student's attention:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity again, place the cursor within "illiterate" and click on the targets button.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Add the text "{error.wav}" to the end of the message. It should look like this:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Person that does not know how to read or write{error.wav}</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check what happens now when a wrong answer is written in this target.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity, place the cursor in the target "poverty" and activate a <B>pop-up information window</B> with the same size and behaviour as the last one. The text could be:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Lack of or great shortage of what is needed to live{error.wav}</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Do the same with the targets "wage" and "survive". The help texts could be:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
Money received in exchange for work{error.wav}<BR>
Continue living{error.wav}<BR>
</P>
<P>We could make a few changes to the activity's appearance to finish off:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity, click on the <B>Fonts</B> button, activate the <B>Help Windows</B> area and change the <B>text</B> colour to red.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Go to <B>Activity options</B> and make the following changes:<P>
<P CLASS="L2"> In the <B>Game window</B> area click on the <B>Solid colour</B> button and change it to <B>white</B> (this will reduce the grey flash visual effect when the help windows are activated).<P>
<P CLASS="L2"> For the <B>Main window</B> click on <B>Image</B>, drop the list and select the <B>bground.gif</B> file.<P>
<P CLASS="L2"> Unmark the <B>Shaded frames</B> box.<P>
<P CLASS="L2"> Select <B>Small buttons 2</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check the activity and save it through the <B>File - Save</B> menu.<P>
