When a complete text activity is started, the blocks marked as <B>targets</B> disappear completely, showing the rest of the document in the game window. The student's task is to complete the text, filling in whatever is missing. The programme does not give any clues as to where missing text has to go or to how many targets have disappeared. As opposed to the previous type of activity, where the student can only write in certain areas (the <I>spaces</I>), here they can write wherever they want and as much as they want.<P>
The <B>evaluation</B> of complete text activities always has to be <I>deferred</I>: the student writes what they think is missing, checks the exercise and, when they think everything is correct, clicks on the correct activity button at the bottom of the screen. Clic then evaluates the work done, highlights possible errors and, if necessary, informs of the number of targets that have not been solved.<P>
