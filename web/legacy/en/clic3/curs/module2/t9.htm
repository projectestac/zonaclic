<H1>The information button</H1>
An extra button that opens a document or an auxiliary application can be placed in any activity:<P>
<IMG SRC="botoinfo.gif" WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=41 BORDER=0 ALT=""><P>
The behaviour of this button is specified in the <B>Activity options</B> screen (CTRL+O) and can have various functions:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Open a Windows help document, as in some Clic "demo" activities (e.g. PUZ05.PUZ). In this case you have to write the name of the <B>HLP</B> document in the <B>File</B> field and, optionally, the title of the page to be activated in the <B>Topic/Arguments</B> field.<BR>
The creation of Windows help documents is a bit complicated, but if you are interested, you can find some tools and documentation in the <B>Resources</B> section of The Clic corner.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Open any document that can be activated by Windows. For example, a BMP image (which will be opened by the Paint utility), a Write (WRI) or a Word file (DOC), a web page (HTM), etc. The file must always have the corresponding format to its extension and be located in the working directory of the activity being edited.<BR>
This technique is used in Antoni Prim i Magda Argemí's <B>Dites dels mesos de l'any</B> activity pack, which you can download from the Click Corner, to open Paint with some black and white that the students can colour in and print.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Start up any executable programme by writing its name in the <B>File</B> field. The programme can be located in the working directory or, if it is a Windows utility, in the C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM folders. The <B>Topic/Arguments</B> field can be used to give additional instructions to the programme.<P>
