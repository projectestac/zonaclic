<H1>Practice 3<BR>Creating a sound-image association</H1>
In this activity we will use the text files created in previous steps to make an association between animal sounds and their photographs. When the student guesses each pair, the animal's name will appear.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate the <B>File - New... - Association</B> menu. The working directory will be the same as in the previous steps.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select a <B>Complex association</B> (even though it could be a normal association, we choose this type as it will allow us a different row and column distribution for grids A and B).<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Set <B>1 column</B> and <B>4 rows</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select the <B>SOUNDSAN.TXT</B> file for grid <B>A</B> and <B>PHOTOSAN.TXT</B> for <B>B</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Mark the <B>Solved grid A</B> box and select the <B>NAMESANI.TXT</B> file.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Write the following in <B>Welcome message</B>:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Link the sound of each animal to its photograph<P>
<P CLASS="L">- And in <B>Good bye message</B>:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Very good!<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Unmark the <B>Delimit cells</B> options for grids <B>A</B> and <B>B</B>.<P>
Check the activity. Everything works well, but we find ourselves once again with the problem of the cell size for the photographs. Follow these steps to fix it:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity (CTRL-E) and click on the <B>relationship assignment</B> button (the one above the <I>Fonts</I> button).<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Set a distribution of <B>2 rows</B> and <B>2 columns</B> for grid B. Check that the settings between the elements in <B>A</B> and <B>B</B> are still correct, as we did in the previous module with the planets.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the operation and click on the <B>Options</B> button.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Change the cell sizes to <B>110 x 80</B> for grid <B>A</B> and <B>220 x 160</B> for grid <B>B</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the operation and check the activity.<P>
Note that when you click the help button (the yellow question mark on the left of the game window), the list of WAV files between curved brackets that correspond to the initial content of grid <B>A</B> appear. In these cases, when the content of <B>A</B> is not a meaningful text, it is recommended to deactivate the <B>help button</B>. You can easily do this in <B>Activity options</B>.<P>
It would also be useful to change <B>grid B</B>'s background colour to grey. You can do this through the <B>Fonts</B> button in the edit activity window.<P>
When you have made these changes, save the activity as <B>ANIMALS3.ASS</B><P>
