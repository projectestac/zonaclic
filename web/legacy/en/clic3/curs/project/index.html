<P>
To finish the course you have to make a Clic activity pack on a subject of your choice, with the following characteristics:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- It has to be all your own work and by no means an adaptation of an existing pack.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- It must have a specific didactic use in one of the areas of the primary or secondary curriculum.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- It must have at least one of each of the basic Clic activities: puzzles, associations, word searches and text activities. Optionally, it may also contain crosswords.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The first activity must be an information screen with the name of the pack and author.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Some type of multimedia resource must be used: digital sound, video or animations.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The images can be your own, taken from the internet, from a CD-ROM or scanned, but if you wish to have the possibility of publishing your work in the "Clic Corner" or on the "Sinera" CD-ROM, the contents used must be of free circulation.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- To save space when sending files, all images must be in GIF format and sounds compressed in <A NAME="this"></A><A HREF="#this" onClick="javascript:window.open('nota1.htm','nota','width=400,height=150,toolbar=0,location=0,status=0,menubar=0,alwaisraised=1,dependent=1')">WAV-MP3 format</A>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The pack should be sent in compact PCC format.<P>
It has to be accompanied by a Word document with:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The author's name, the pack name, the educational area and level that it is aimed at.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A brief description of the objectives that you hope to achieve through use of the material.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A brief description of the pack's contents and structure.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A Bibliography and/or a list of the origin of the multimedia and graphical material used.<P>
Before starting on the pack, send a message to the course tutor outlining the project you have in mind: subject, type of activities, etc. The tutor can give some advice on techniques to use when developing the activities and possible sources of multimedia materials.<P>
Once you have finished, compress everything (PCC file, multimedia files and Word document) in a ZIP file and send it to the course tutor.<P>
