Download the "Les Illes Balears" activity pack, created by Àngela Martín and Joan Saura from C.P. Montaura, Manacor de la Vall, from the "Clic Corner" and install it on your computer.<P>
Look through the pack. You will that some activities have a general content (geographical location of the Islands, their silhouette on the map, Majorca's mountain ranges, etc.) and that others go into further detail that exceed the basic content that we would use with students here in Catalonia (location of all the towns on each of the islands, mountain peak names etc.).<P>
The practical exercise we propose here is to separate the pack, copy it to the practice folder for session 4, choose the activities that we want to use with our students and create a new pack (that we could call <B>balears2.pac</B>) that only contains the selected activities.<P>
If you wish, you can make the most of the process and make a few changes in some of the activities (fonts, colours, fix a puzzle that has two identical cells, etc.) and add some activity you feel appropriate.<P>
When you have finished, compact the balears2.pac pack so as to obtain the compact version, <B>balears2.pcc</B>. Put it in a ZIP file along with <B>verygood.wav</B> and send it by email to your course tutor.<P>
