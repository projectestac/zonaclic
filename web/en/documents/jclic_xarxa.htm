          | </strong>JClic in a network</p>
        <p class="t1">Installation of JClic in a network</p>
        <p align="justify">There are two features of JClic that will allow us
          to optimize its use
        in the school network:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>To configure the reports system</strong><br>
    JClic reports runs in the server and
    carries out two functions: to compile information on the JClic activities
    carried out by the students, and
    to represent statistical reports based on the results of these activities.</li>
          <li><strong>To use the same projects library from all the
              computers</strong><br>
    This will facilitate the management of the packages of activities:
    they are installed once in the server and
    become available to any computer connected to the network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first feature is explained in the <a href="../jclic/reports/index.htm"><strong>instructions
              of configuration of<em> JClic reports</em></strong></a>.
              Is advised to read them before continuing.</p>
        <p>As you will have seen, there are two operation modes of <em>JClic
            reports</em>:
            <strong>standard</strong> (single Java application) and <strong>advanced</strong>          (using
            Tomcat). Some of the steps to follow now will depend on the chosen
            mode.</p>
        <p class="t2">Configuration of the server</p>
        <p>We will make two tasks in the server: to share a folder and to create
          a JClic projects library on it.</p>
        <p class="t3">Creation of the shared folder </p>
        <p>There are some examples of how to share a folder, both in standard
          and advanced operation modes:</p>
        <p><strong>Standard operation mode:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In Windows, if the server already
            has a folder or a shared unit (for
            example <span class="codi">S:</span> or <span class="codi">C:\S</span>),
            we can create a subfolder <span class="codi">S:\JClic</span> or <span class="codi">C:\S\JClic</span>.</li>
          <li>Also in Windows, if we don't have any
            generic shared resource, we can create a folder <span class="codi">C:\JClic</span> and
            share it with the name "JClic".</li>
          <li>In Linux there are at least two systems of sharing folders:<strong> NFS</strong> (<em>Network
                File System</em>) and <strong>SMB</strong> (<em>Samba</em>).
                In bot, we can make use of an existing shared resource
                creating a subfolder called "JClic" in it ,
                or we can create a new folder and make it a shared
                resource.</li>
          <li>In Mac OS X  we can also share folders in an AppleTalk network
            through AFP (Apple
                Filing Protocol). In <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20011108161839416" class="extern">this
                article</a> you can read how to share a folder in read-only mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advanced operation mode:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If in the first part we have choose to use <em>JClic reports</em> in
            the advanced operation mode (<em>Linux</em> + <em>Tomcat</em> + <em>MySQL</em>),
            we can create a directory called "JClic" in the root of Tomcat, usually
            located in <span class="codi">/usr/share/tomcat<em>x</em>/webapps</span>.
            (where "x" is the version of Tomcat being used).</li>
          <li>Also if we have the <em>Apache</em> web server installed,
              we can create the folder "JClic" in its root,
              since <em>Apache</em> is more safe and efficient
              that <em>Tomcat</em> serving static files.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p class="t3">Creation of the shared library of JClic projects </p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p>The steps to create the shared library of JClic projects are:</p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Launch <a href="../jclic/download.htm">JClic player</a> in
              the server.<br>
                <em>Note: If the server does
                not have a graphic window manager,
                launch JClic in another computer with read and write access to
                the shared folder.</em> </li>
          <li>Go to <strong>Tools - Libraries</strong> and click on <strong>New</strong>.</li>
          <li>In the dialog window, leave checked the option
            <strong>Create new project library</strong> and click
            on <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
          <li>Select the "JClic" shared folder created in the previous step.
              The program suggests to create in it a file named <span class="codi">library.jclic</span>.
              Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
          <li>You will see a new element in the list of libraries, named "New
              project library". Select it, click on <strong>Edit </strong>and
              change its name to "Shared
              Library".</li>
        </ul>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p class="t3">Installing JClic projects in the server</p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p>In the server, launch a browser, go to the <a href="../../db/listact_en.jsp">library
            of activities</a> of the <strong>clicZone</strong> and install some
            projects in the shared library that we have just created.</p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p>Also in the server, launch JClic and go to <strong>Tools - Libraries</strong>.
          Select the shared library and click on <strong>Edit</strong>. Here
          you can create folders and subfolders (for thematic
          areas, for working projects, for groups...). You can also cut, copy
          and paste the project icons in order to move it from one folder to
          another.</p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p class="t3">Last details in the server</p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p>To prevent confusions, it can be convenient to eliminate all
            the project libraries except the shared one. This can be done from
          the JClic menu        <strong>Tools - Libraries</strong>. </p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p>It is also advisable to assign a password to JClic,
          in order to prevent unauthorized access to the configuration and management
          of the library. This can be done from <strong>Tools</strong> - <strong>Settings</strong> <strong>- Security</strong>.</p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p class="t2">Configuration of the clients </p>
        <strong> </strong>
        <p>The clients must be configurated one by one. The good news
            are that we must to make it once.</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p class="t3">Finding out the path to the shared library </p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p>We must start discovering how to reach the file <span class="codi">library.jclic</span> from
          the network clients. Some examples are:<strong><strong> </strong></strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Standard operating mode:</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>In Windows clients, the path will probably be:<br>
            <span class="codi">\\nameoftheserver\S\JClic\library.jclic,</span> or              <span class="codi">\\nameoftheserver\JClic\library.jclic</span>.</li>
          <li>In Linux clients the shared unit must be mounted in order to be
            available to JClic, through <em>mount</em> or <em>smbmount</em>.
              Once gotten on, we will find the resource in a directory like <span class="codi">/mnt/S/JClic/library.jclic</span> (if
              we are making use of a resource "S" that
              we already had gotten on), or <span class="codi">/mnt/JClic/library.jclic</span>,
              if we have created a specific mount point for the shared folder.</li>
          <li>In Mac OS X we can get on the volume from the <strong>Finder</strong> (menu <strong>Go</strong>            -
                <strong>Connect to the server</strong>).
                Once gotten on, the library will be accessible in <span class="codi">/Volumes/S/JClic/library.jclic</span>,
                or in <span class="codi">/Volumes/JClic/library.jclic</span>.<strong><strong> </strong></strong> </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Advanced operating mode:</strong></p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If the server has
              been configured in the advanced mode, Tomcat will
              allow you to enter the library through the HTTP protocol.
              The path will be a URL like:<br>
                <br>
                <span class="codi">http://nameoftheserver:XXXX/JClic/library.jclic</span><br>
                <br>
    where <em>nameoftheserver</em> can be the name of
    the server or its ip
    address, and <em>XXXX</em>  is
    the port number where Tomcat is running. By
    default it is <strong>8180</strong> for <em>Tomcat 4</em> and <strong>8080</strong> for <em>Tomcat
    5</em>.</li>
          <li>If the server has also <em>Apache</em> installed and you have decided
            to create here the library folder, the URL will be similar
              but with another port number (or without any port number
              if <em>Apache</em> runs on port 80). </li>
        </ul>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p class="t3">Configuring JClic</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>In each of the network clients, launch <em>JClic</em>.
            This can be made from the <a href="../jclic/download.htm">downloading
            and installation page</a>.</li>
          <li>Go to <strong>Tools - Settings - Libraries</strong>.</li>
          <li>Leave checked the box <em>Automatically go to
            libraries when JClic starts</em>.</li>
          <li> Click on <strong>New</strong> and select the option <em>Add a
            link to an existing project library</em>.</li>
          <li>In the <em>File or URL</em> field, write on the path to the file <span class="codi">library.jclic</span> that
            we have found out in the previous step.</li>
          <li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
          <li>Close JClic and check that wen starting it again we can access
            to the shared library.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p class="t3">Last details in the clients </p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>It can be convenient to eliminate the "main Library" and to leave
            only the "shared Library". This will avoid the dialog window that
            always appears as JClic starts, prompting us which library we want
            to load. It can
              be suppressed from <strong>Tools -
              Libraries</strong>.</li>
          <li>It can also be convenient to protect the configuration
              with a password. This can be done in <strong>Tools
              - Settings - Security</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p class="t2">Maintenance of the system</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p>If new projects have to be installed or the structure
              of the shared library has to be modified, by always making it from
              the servant|server, since the customers
              do not have laws|rights of writing.</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p>It|He|She has to be taken
              into account that for erasing an icon of the library (from the
              menu <strong>Herramientas - Libraries
              - To Edit</strong>) are not erased the files of its|his|her|their project.
              These will continue in the folder of the library. Totally to eliminate
              a project its|his|her|their folder
              has to be suppressed manually.</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p class="t2">Advanced functionality </p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p>In this document he|she|it has
              explained itself|himself|herself as
              creating only one shared library, but there can be other solutions,
              as creating a specific library for every cycle or course. We have
              also supposed that there is only one servant|server that
              acts as servant|server of reports
              and the library of projects houses. Evidently, these tasks can
              be divided up among different computers also.</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p>If the advanced modality has been opted for and the
              library has been placed in the <em>Apache servant|server</em>,
              and if this servant|server has exit
              to Internet, your pupils|students will
              be able to be connected also from home|house:
              it will only be necessary that they start off JClic, go to <strong>Herramientas -
              Libraries</strong> and think a new library noting|pointing the
              corresponding URL (<em>http://servidor.dominio/JClic/library.jclic</em>).
              Like this they will be able to work with the same projects as at
              school.</p>
        <strong><strong> </strong></strong>
        <p>And a last trick: the shared library is also in the <em>Apache</em> with servant|server exit
              to Internet you can do that the pupils|students access
              to it|her directly (without pulling
              nor configuring JClic) unloading <a href="http://www.comprendium.es:8080/home_ca/url.do?translationDirection=SPANISH-ENGLISH&amp;url=http://clic.xtec.cat/es/documents/../../pub/index.zip&amp;subjectArea=%28CTV%29">this zip</a> file
              and extracting to the folder of the library the document <span class="codi">index.html</span> that
              contains. The library will be then accessible in <em>http://servidor.dominio/JClic/index.html</em>.</p>
