<H1>Practice 3<BR>Creating order words activities</H1>
In this activity we will present a text where some words are shuffled which have to be put back in place:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Create a <B>new text activity</B> and select the <B>Order words</B> kind.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Write the following text:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
This girl is called Ramdwa Saidi. She is 11 years old and lives in Tanzania. She wants to go to school, but she cannot. Before, school was free and Ramdwa and her sister went to school.&para;<BR>
Her country's government was forced to start charging fees and her mother, Mwange, does not have the money to pay them, nor can she afford the uniforms or all the material needed to go to school.
</P>
<P CLASS="L">- The appearance of the activity will be similar to the one we created in the last exercise. Click on the <B>Options</B> button and on <B>Copy style from</B>. Select the <B>educa1.txa</B> file and accept. Before closing the options window, mark the <B>Image</B> box for the main window and select <B>bground.gif</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Insert a blank line at the start of the document.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Insert a <B>box</B> in this line with a size of <B>90 x 130</B>, without a <B>frame</B> and with the text <B>{ramdwa.gif}</B><P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the changes with the <B>OK</B> button to see the appearance of the activity.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save it as <B>RAMDWA1.TXA</B> and <A NAME="this"></A><A HREF="#this" onClick="javascript:window.open('nota1.htm','Nota','width=200,height=200,toolbar=0,location=0,status=0,menubar=0,alwaisRaised=1,dependent=1')">go back to the edit window (CTRL+E)</A>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Place the cursor just in front of the photograph, insert three spaces on the same line and click on the insert <B>boxes</B> button again. This time set the size to <B>300 x 60</B>, unmark the <B>Centre text</B> and <B>With frame</B> boxes and write:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">RAMDWA</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the creation of the box, click on the <B>Fonts</B> button, activate the <B>Text in boxes</B> area and select the <B>Arial</B> font at <B>12 x 30</B> in <B>bold</B>. Change the colour of the <B>text</B> orange (or any other that you like) and accept.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Place the cursor in the word "girl" and click on the <B>target creation</B> button. Note that the whole word is highlighted with a different colour.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select the following words from the first paragraph as targets as well: "Tanzania", "school" and "sister".<P>
<P CLASS="L">- And these words from the second paragraph "government", "fees" and "money".<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check the activity.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Write a <B>welcome message</B> such as: "Put the shuffled words back in their place", and a congratulatory good bye message.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>correction options</B> button <IMG SRC="botoavalua.gif" WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0 ALT=""> and change the text under the <B>Correction button</B> to:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Click here when you finish</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check the activity.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- We could make one last change to improve the appearance of the activity. Go to the edit window (CTRL+E), click on the <B>Fonts</B> button, select the <B>Main text</B> area and click on the <B>User background</B> button. Change the colour from grey to white and confirm everything.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save the document again with the same name: <B>RAMDWA1.TXA</B><P>
Now we will make a second activity, which will be the continuation of this one. Instead of starting from zero we will save the activity that we have just made with another name and then make some changes:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Go to the <B>File - Save as...</B> menu and change the name so that a copy is saved by the name of <B>RAMDWA2.TXA</B><P>
<P CLASS="L">- Delete the whole text except for the first line (where the two boxes are with the heading and the photograph). If you accidentally delete either of the boxes, reopen the RAMDWA2.TXA file that we just saved in the last step.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Write the following text:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
If the Tanzanian government had more money, school would be free again. But Tanzania invests three times more in paying its foreign debt than it spends on education. Relief of foreign debt and an increase in international help for basic education would allow Ramdwa, her sister and all the children in the world to go to school.
</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Set the following words as targets: "invests", "debt", "foreign", "help", "international" and "school".<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check the activity.<P>
It would be better if "foreign debt" and "international help" behaved as single blocks rather than two separate words. To fix this do the following:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Place the cursor in front of "debt" and delete the space that separates it from "foreign".<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Type the space again. There is no apparent difference, but the two words have changed into a single block.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Do the same with "international help".<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check the activity and save it through the <B>File - Save</B> menu.<P>
