Look in a newspaper for six brief articles (or pieces of articles), of between 100 and 150 words. Make the following with the articles:<P>
<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A "fill in blanks" text activity with four missing words for the student to fill in. Use help windows for any words that are not easily identifiable from the context.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Another "fill in blanks" activity, where four targets are set in form of a list of options.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- An "identify words" text activity where all  nouns in a text have to be marked.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- An "order paragraphs" text activity. Here it is important that you use a text made up of a logical sequence of short paragraphs.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- An "order words" activity, where ten words in the text are shuffled.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A pack that joins the six activities together.<P>
All the activities and the pack should be saved in the practical exercises folder for module 3.<P>
When you have finished, compress the materials in a ZIP file and send it to the course tutor.<P>
To find the texts you could use a conventional newspaper or the electronic edition that most newspapers offer on the internet. <P>
If you use the electronic edition, you can take advantage and use some of the images that accompany the articles and insert one in a box in the activities. Make sure that the images are <A NAME="this"></A><A HREF="#this" onClick="javascript:window.open('nota2.htm','Nota','width=200,height=180,toolbar=0,location=0,status=0,menubar=0,alwaisRaised=1,dependent=1')">quite small</A> so that enough space is left for the body of the activity.<P>
