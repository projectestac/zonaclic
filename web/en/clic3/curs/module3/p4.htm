<H1>Practice 4<BR>Creating an order paragraphs activity</H1>
In this activity, some of the paragraphs from the text will be shuffled and have to be put back in order.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate the <B>File - New... - Text activity</B> menu.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Change the kind to <B>Order paragraphs</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Go to <B>Activity options</B> and copy the style from <B>RAMDWA2.TXT</B>. Remember that the <B>Image</B> box for the main window has to be activated.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Start by inserting a <B>box</B> of 400 x 50, without a frame or centred text and with the following text:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">FAIR COMMERCE</P>
<P CLASS="L">- Insert a <B>return</B> after the box and write:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
We live in a global world. Sugar can come from Brazil, coffee from Uganda, bananas from Ecuador and clothes from Taiwan or Morocco.&para;<BR>
The communities in these countries that make the products we consume have very tough working conditions: long working hours, low wages, discrimination against women, exploitation of child labour, drainage of natural resources, prohibition of unions...&para;<BR>
Changing this situation, helping to make decent working conditions in the South is our job as well. We are all implicated and our actions in the North will have repercussions for the communities in the South.&para;<BR>
We have to spread and support fair commerce and buy responsibly, in favour of the people in the third world.<BR>
