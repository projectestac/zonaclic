Creating a puzzle from a text</H1>
In this activity the pieces of the puzzle are the lines of a text file instead of being the rectangles that make up an image:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate the <B>File - New... - Puzzle</B> menu. If the programme asks if you wish to save the activity created in the previous exercise, say <B>NO</B>.<BR>
The working directory will be the same as in the previous exercise: <B>C:\Clic\Course\Module1\Practice</B><P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Text</B> field and note that the expression NEW TEXT appears in the drop list.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate the <B>Edit contents</B> menu. The programme will ask what name you want to give the text file that we are going to create. Write <B>PLANETS</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The Notepad programme will start up, this is the most simple text editor incorporated in Windows. Write the names of the planets, one on each line:
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
MERCURY<BR>
VENUS<BR>
EARTH<BR>
MARS<BR>
JUPITER<BR>
SATURN<BR>
URANUS<BR>
NEPTUNE<BR>
PLUTO
<P CLASS="L">- Close Notepad and when it asks whether you want to save the changes, answer <B>YES</B>.<P>
Note that the PLANETS.TXT file is already selected in the list of activity contents. If this is not the case, drop the list and select it manually.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- As there are 9 planets we have three options for the distribution of the cells:: 3x3, 9x1 or 1x9. We will try with <B>3 rows and 3 columns</B> for a start. Select <B>Double</B> mode as well.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- In <B>Welcome message</B> write the text:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Put the planets in order of proximity to the sun<P>
<P CLASS="L">- ...and in <B>Good bye message</B>:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Fantastic!<P>
Confirm the activity and test it. Although the activity seems to work well, it does not seem very logical to order a list of words in a two-dimensional grid. It would be more understandable to organize the words in a single row or column:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity and change it to <B>1 column and 9 rows</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Check how it works.<P>
To finish, save the activity as <B>PLANET1.PUZ</B><P>
