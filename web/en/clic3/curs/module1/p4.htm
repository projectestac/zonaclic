<H1>Practice 4<BR>
Creating a text-image association</H1>
In this exercise we will link the names of the planets with certain areas of an image.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Activate the <B>File - New... - Association</B> menu and confirm that you want to continue working in the <B>C:\Clic\Course\Module1\Practice </B>folder<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Change the <B>Kind</B> to <B>Complex association</B>. In this guided practice grid <B>B</B> will have more areas than grid <B>A</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- For grid <B>A</B> select the type <B>Text</B>, drop the list and select the <B>PLANETS.TXT</B> file which we created in the previous activity.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- For grid <B>B</B> select the type <B>Image</B>, drop the list and look for the <B>PLANETS.GIF</B> file.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select <B>3 columns</B> and <B>3 rows</B>. This is the layout we will use for the grid on the left.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Relationship assignment</B> button <IMG SRC="miniassigna.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 ALT=""> and type <B>5</B> in <B>B Columns </B>and <B>6</B> in <B>B Rows</B>. This image has been made, thinking specifically in this cell layout.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select the word <B>Mercury</B> from the list on the left and, on the right, click on the cell showing this planet (the one nearest the sun).<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Then click on <B>Venus</B> and the corresponding cell in the image on the left.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Continue like this for the rest of the planets, always selecting from list <B>A</B> first and then clicking on the corresponding cell in <B>B</B>. As the image is compressed, there are some planets that cannot be seen very well. Pluto is a small stain at the top left of the image.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the relationship assignment by clicking on <B>OK</B>. We then go back to the edit activity window.<P>
We could check the aspect of the activity by clicking on <B>OK</B> again. It is not quite what we hoped for because the content of <B>B</B> is disordered and the graphic looses its meaning. We can go back to editing the activity by typing <B>CTRL+E</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Unmark the <B>Delimit cells</B> and <B>Shuffle</B> boxes for grid <B>B</B>. The ones in grid <B>A</B> can be left marked.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Write a <B>welcome message</B> such as:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Find each planet in this diagram<P>
<P CLASS="L">- ... and a <B>good bye message</B> of congratulations.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Test the activity.<P>
Save the file as <B>PLANET2.ASS</B><P>
