The best way to get to know Clic is by looking at the example activities which are installed with the programme. Activate the <B>Clic Demo</B> icon and go along, following the menus, which will take you through the different types of activities. If you feel like seeing how the activities have been made, you only have to activate the menus: <B>Edit - Edit activity</B> (basic definition of the contents and operating mode of the activity); and <B>Options - Activity options</B> (visual aspect and other properties). Do not worry if you do not understand the function of each component of these windows; this will become clear over the duration of the course. For now, the idea is just to have a look and understand the different types of activities that the programme allows.<P>
