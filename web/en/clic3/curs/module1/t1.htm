Clic is an open programme which allows the carrying out of various educational activities: puzzles, associations, word searches, crosswords, text activities and other types which we will discover over the duration of the modules of this course.<P>
Before starting the practice exercises you will need to make some changes to the default settings in Clic:
<UL>
<LI>Start up Clic and go to the <B>Options - Global options</B> menu<P>
<LI>Notice the area where it says <B>Graph programme</B>. By default it says PBRUSH.EXE, which is the basic drawing programme in Windows. <B>Paintbrush</B> only lets you work with <B>BMP</B> files and we will also be using <B>GIF</B> images in this course. So we will have to change the setting to <B>Paint Shop Pro</B> (or any other programme capable of editing GIF files).<P>
<LI>Click on the <B>Search...</B> button in this area and find the <B>PSP.EXE</B> file, which is normally in the <B>C:\PROGRA~1\PAINTS~1</B> folder, which is the equivalent of "C:\Program Files\Paint Shop Pro" (Clic is a 16-bit programme and cannot 'see' the folders and files with the long names as in Windows 95, that is why the equivalent expressions, abbreviated to 8 characters must always be used).<P>
<LI>Click <B>OK</B> and, when Clic asks, say <B>Yes</B> you want to keep the changes made.<P>
</UL>
