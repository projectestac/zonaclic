<H1>The packs</H1>
The activities can be grouped by sequences in <B>activity packs</B>. A pack is, basically, an ordered list of activities which are presented to the student so that they are done one after the other. The progression from one activity to another can be made manually (clicking on the back and forward buttons) or automatically (the programme moves on to the following activity after a certain time). It is also possible to design pack <B>threadings</B> according to the results obtained (global precision and time), so that the programme moves on to an easier or more difficult pack according to the scale of accuracy the user has shown.<P>
Clic uses two types of activity packs: the <B>normal Clic packs</B> are saved in <B>.PAC</B> files and can be freely edited and modified at any time. The <B>compact Clic packs</B> have the <B>.PCC</B> extension and gather all the parts (texts, graphics, associations, puzzles, etc.) needed by the activities which make up the pack in a single file with the exception of external programmes and multimedia files. The compact Clic packs cannot be modified directly and are of the ideal format for distribution of the applications once finished. The <B>ClicPac</B> utility, which we will see in module 4, allows the conversion from open to compact format and vice versa.<P>
