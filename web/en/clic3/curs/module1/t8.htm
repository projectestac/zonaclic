<H1>Explicit and indirect references to contents</H1>
To design an activity with Clic you have to tell the programme which "ingredients" appear will be used: texts, graphics, sounds, animations, etc. The selection of these contents can be made <B>directly</B> (selecting a file from a list of the available texts and images), or by means of indirect calls.<P>
Indirect calls are always made by writing the name of the file which contains the information that you want to show between curved brackets (<B>{</B> and <B>}</B>). For example, if {verygood.wav} is given as the text for the good bye message when creating an activity, we will hear the contents of the "verygood.wav" file (which will have been previously recorded) when the activity is finished.<P>
Indirect calls can also be used for other special functions and commands, e.g.: skip to another activity or pack; start up an external programme; record a sound with the microphone; reproduce a previously recorded sound; leave Clic; etc. You will find a full list of the different instructions allowed by the programme in the <B>Import graphics, multimedia resources and other special commands</B> section of the Clic manual.<P>
<B>Multiple references</B> to external files may be combined in a single cell, but only when their contents are compatible. For example, we could write "{hello.bmp}{hello.wav}" in a message box or a cell and that would make the hello.bmp image appear while the hello.wav sound is heard. A sound and a graphic can be selected, but not two different sounds or two different graphics at the same time.<P>
