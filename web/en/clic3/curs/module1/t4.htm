<H1>Types of activities</H1>
As you have seen in the examples, Clic allows the use of five basic types of activity:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>puzzles</B> consist of rearranging a disordered piece of information. This information can be in the form of a graphic, text, sound, or a combination of graphics and sound together.<P>
<LI>The <B>associations</B> are intended for the user to find the relations between two sets of information.<P>
<LI>The <B>word searches</B> and <B>crosswords</B> are interactive versions of their well-known printed versions.<P>
<LI>The <B>text activities</B> offer exercises based on words, sentences, letters, and paragraphs of a text which has to be completed, understood, corrected or ordered. The texts may also contain images and windows with an active content.<P>
</UL>
Some of these activities have different forms, giving 19 different possibilities:
