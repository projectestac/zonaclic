<H1>Evaluation of the results</H1>
Clic keeps a record of the actions that the student makes to resolve each of the activities. This is converted into a numeral variable called <B>precision</B>, which indicates the percentage of correct answers for the total of guesses made. A 100% precision indicates that the activity has been solved in the minimum number of guesses and without any errors.<P>
Clic 3.0 allows the <B>precision</B> obtained and the <B>time</B> taken by each student in the different work sessions to be recorded in a database. The <B>ClicDB</B>, which we will see further on, facilitates information queries in this database following various criteria, presenting the information in graphical form where each student's evolution can be seen.<P>
