<H1>Clic reporting system</H1>
Clic v3.0 allows a detailed assessment of the students' results in each of the activities they do.<P>
The evaluated items are:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- <B>Time </B>used<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Number of <B>attempts</B><P>
<P CLASS="L">- Number of <B>correct answers</B><P>
<P CLASS="L">- Whether an activity has been <B>solved</B> or not<P>
<P CLASS="L">- <B>Precision</B> obtained. This value is calculated as follows:<P>
<P CLASS="Enum2">a)	First of all, the minimum amount of attempts necessary to solve the activity is calculated, which we will call "n".<P>
<P CLASS="Enum2">b)	If the activity has been solved, "n" is divided by the number of attempts made by the user.<P>
<P CLASS="Enum2">c)	If the activity has not been solved, the square of the correct answers is divided by the product between "n" and the attempts made.<P>
In both cases the result is multiplied by 100 to express it in percentage form.<P>
A list of the values of these five items for each activity done can be accessed through the <B>Reports - Show current report</B> menu. A summary of the session, with the totals and average precision obtained can be found at the bottom of the window.<P>
Certain activities are never evaluated or taken into account for the totals and averages. These are the information screens, explore mode associations and, in general, any activity where the <B>Include in user reports</B> box in <B>Activity options</B> is not marked. It is important to unmark this box when creating activities that should not count in the global report, for example: an association used as a menu to select different packs (like the MENUACT.ASS file in the Clic demo); or a text activity that is only used to present information (e.g. the NOU02.TXA file in the demo).<P>
The reports can be saved in a <B>database</B>. The system can work on a network so that the results accumulate in a common database for the whole classroom, independently of where the student sits in each session. You can find detailed instructions for configuring the reporting system on a network in the appendix of the<B> Clic manual</B>.<P>
To register the reports in a database you have to go to <B>Global options</B> and mark the <B>Register activity reports</B> box. You also have to say where the information file is located, which is normally called <B>CLICDB.MDB</B> and found in the Clic folder or, if the computer is linked to a network, in a shared folder that can be written in.<P>
