<A HREF="prac2.zip"><IMG SRC="../disquet.gif" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=39 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT"></A>You will need to download the <A HREF="prac2.zip">prac2.zip</A>  file to do the guided practices for this module. Decompress its contents in the <B>C:\Clic\Course\Module2\Practice</B> folder.<P>

In this exercise some materials are used from the "Enciclopedia multimedia de los seres vivos" CD-ROM published by "Editorial Planeta", which came free with the Sunday editions of the "La Vanguardia" newspaper in 1997.
<H1>Practice 1<BR>Creating an explore mode activity</H1>
In this exercise we will make an activity that allows the discovery of the names of four animals:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Start up Clic and activate the <B>File - New... - Association</B> menu. The working directory will be the one corresponding to the guided practices in Module 2 (where you have just decompressed the ZIP file).<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Select <B>explore mode</B> in the area at the top of the edit window.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- We will use 4 animal photographs in this exercise. So you should set a layout of <B>2 rows</B> and <B>2 columns</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- We will place the animal photographs in <B>grid A</B>. As they are in 4 separate files, we will have to do this with indirect calls from a text file. Select <B>Text</B> for the type, leave the entry <B>NEW TEXT</B> selected and click <B>Edit contents</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- The programme will ask for a file name. Write <B>PHOTOSAN</B> and accept the operation.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Write the following four lines in the Windows notepad:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
{elephant.gif}<BR>
{leopard.gif}<BR>
{wolf.gif}<BR>
{dolphin.gif}<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save the file and close the Windows notepad.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- We will also use a <B>text</B> file for <B>grid B</B>. Here we will write the names of the four animals. Leave the entry <B>NEW TEXT</B> selected and click on <B>Edit contents</B>. The file name will be NAMESANI.TXT (you only have to write <B>NAMESANI</B>), and the content will be the following:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
Elephant<BR>
Leopard<BR>
Wolf<BR>
Dolphin<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save the file and close the Windows notepad.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- There is no need to write a good bye message in explore mode activities. Write the following sentence in <B>Welcome message</B>:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Click on the photographs to know the names of these animals<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm the creation of the activity by clicking <B>OK</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save it as <B>ANIMALS1.ASS</B>.<P>
It seems to work, but the photographs are cut off in the cells. Let's fix it:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity (CTRL+E keys) and change the <B>placement</B> of the grids to type <B>A above B</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Options</B> button and change the dimensions of <B>grid A</B> so that they have a width of <B>220</B> and a height of <B>150</B> points. For grid B set the dimensions at <B>220 x 40</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- There is no need to solve anything in explore mode activities so unmark the <B>Placed</B>, <B>Attempts</B> and <B>Time</B> markers.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm everything and check the activity. It should now work much better!<P>
The white background does not go very well with the photographs. We will make a few esthetical changes:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity again (CTRL+E) and click on the <B>Fonts</B> button.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Mark the <B>Messages</B> box and click on the <B>Apply to all areas</B> button. This makes the grey background colour the same for the whole screen (we could have also changed it area by area but this way is quicker).<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Mark the <B>Grid B</B> box and select a font size of <B>12 x 30</B> and <B>Bold</B> style. Click on the <B>Text</B> button, select red and confirm.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- We are back in the edit activity window. unmark the boxes where it says <B>Delimit cells</B> for grid <B>A</B> and <B>B</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Options</B> button and unmark the <B>Shaded frames</B> box.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm everything and test the activity again.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save it again with the same name: <B>ANIMALS1.ASS</B><P>
