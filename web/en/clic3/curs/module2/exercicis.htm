You will find four photographs of musical instruments and four WAV files with and example of their sound in the ZIP file. The photographs are 200 x 200 maximum, and the sound files have been compressed in MPEG-3 format to occupy the minimum possible space.
<P>
With this material you should make:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- An explore mode activity which lets you hear each instrument's sound when you click on its photograph.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- An association between the photographs and names of the instruments. As each pair is linked, make the instrument's sound be heard.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- An association between the sounds and the photographs.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A word search with the names of the instruments, making each instrument's photograph appear and sound be heard when its name is found.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- A pack with all these activities.<P>
To make better use of the space available, we recommend that you work with a configuration of 800x600 for the Windows screen.<P>
When you have finished, compress the materials in a ZIP file and send it to the course tutor by e-mail.<P>
