The <B>Copy style from...</B> button, which appears in the activity options window, can be used to homogenise the appearance of various activities that have to be gathered together in the same pack. Here is the process that would need to be followed:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Create an activity and change the colours, fonts, background images, etc. until you get the desired appearance.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save the activity.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Create a second activity and, before defining the content, go to <B>Activity options</B> (CTRL+O) and click on the <B>Copy style from...</B> button. Select the name of the "patron" activity that we created in the previous step and confirm. With this action we will give the new activity the same appearance as the previous one.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Complete the creation of the second activity, altering the cell sizes and text size if necessary.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Follow the same process for the remaining activities in the pack.<P>
Cell sizes are usually a very specific characteristic to each activity. After importing an external style, it is important to always check them.<P>
