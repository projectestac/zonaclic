Integrating AVI files</H1>
AVI files contain digital video sequences that usually take up a lot of space and, therefore, are only recommendable for use in applications that will later be distributed on CD-ROM. The ones used in this exercise are very small to facilitate downloading from the Internet.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Create a <B>new association</B> in the same working directory used so far.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Set a distribution of <B>2 rows</B> and <B>2 columns</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- You should create a <B>NEW TEXT</B> in grid <B>A</B> called <B>AVIANI.TXT</B>. Its content should be as follows:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
{deer.avi}<BR>
{frog.avi}<BR>
{zebra.avi}<BR>
{bear.avi}<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Create a new text file called <B>NAMESAN2.TXT</B> for grid B (to distinguish it from NAMESANI that we have used previously) and write:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
Deer<BR>
Frog<BR>
Zebra<BR>
Bear<P>
<P CLASS="L">- In <B>Welcome message</B> write:<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">Do you know these animals?<P>
<P CLASS="L">- And a message of congratulation in <B>Good bye message</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Click on the <B>Options</B> button and set the cell size at <B>120 x 88</B> for grids <B>A</B> and <B>B</B>. This is the size of the example videos which come with the ZIP file corresponding to this guided practice.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Confirm everything and test the activity.<P>
You will have noticed that on starting the activity there are film roll icons shown in the cells in grid <B>A</B>. This is the standard image that Clic uses when there is only an animation or a video in an area, the same way as a speaker is shown for WAV files. This initial appearance could be modified to include a message or an image in each cell while the AVI video is inactive.<P>
Some GIF images representing the first still of each video are included in the practice materials. The objective of the following steps is to combine these GIF images with the AVI files to give the sensation of a board of images that start moving when clicked:<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Edit the activity (CTRL+E) and click on the <B>Edit contents</B> button for grid <B>A</B>.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Change the <B>AVIANI.TXT</B> file so that it ends up as follows (The character at the end of the GIF files is a zero, not a capital "o"):<P>
<P CLASS="LiteralL">
{deer0.gif}{deer.avi}<BR>
{frog0.gif}{frog.avi}<BR>
{zebra0.gif}{zebra.avi}<BR>
{bear0.gif}{bear.avi}<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save the changes and check the activity.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Deactivate the <B>help</B> button, as the text does not show any meaningful text.<P>
<P CLASS="L">- Save the activity as <B>ANIMALS5.ASS</B><P>
