        <UL>
          There is compatibility problem between Windows 98, NT and 2000 with 
          applications made with VisualBasic 3.0 (like ClicDB) and some HP printers 
          when the screen is configured to more than 256 colours. The problem 
          is explained in <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q108/4/70.asp" class="extern">Microsoft 
          support pages</A>. 
          <p> <B>Solution</B>: Configure the screen to 256 colours before printing, 
            using the "Screen" icon in the Control panel of Windows. When done, 
            return to the original resolution of 16 million colours.</p>

        <B>I can't install the activity packs found in the Clic corner!</B> <FONT SIZE=-1> 
        <UL>
          This problem can be due to one of the following reasons: 
          <P> <B>a) "Corrupt installation media" message appears</B><BR>
            It means the installation file has become corrupt during the downloading 
            process. The only solution is to delete the bad file and download 
            it again.
          <P> The installer files larger than 1.4 MB are divided into separated 
            pieces for easier copy to diskettes. The first portion always contains 
            the EXE extension and the rest have the same name but with ending 
            with W02, W03.etc. The normal process is to copy all the files into 
            a single folder in the hard disk and then run the first file, which 
            will access the information contained in the others when necessary. 
            You can also copy each file into a separate disk, run the first one 
            and the change them when the installer program asks for it.<BR>
            The problem can appear when the files are downloaded using <B>Internet 
            Explorer 5.0</B>, since in some cases the file can be saved with the 
            name changed. For example, it could happen that when downloading the 
            file COSHUMA.W02 it gets saved in your computer with the name COSHUMA.W02 
            (with two dots) or COSHUMA.W02.W02 (The extension is repeated). Solution: 
            manually rename the file so that it has its original name (in this 
            case COSHUMA.W02).
          <p> <B>c) The installer says I have an old version of Clic already installed</B><BR>
            The installers base their operations on the information found on the 
            section <B>[Extensions]</B> of the file <B>win.ini</B>. The win.ini 
            file is updated while the installation of Clic, but this information 
            stops being valid if we move or rename the Clic folder. For example, 
            if you have dragged the Clic folder to "Program Files" probably you 
            will find this error message. Solution: repeat the installation of 
            Clic 3.0 indicating the folder where you really want to place the 
            program.</p>

        <B>How can I modify Clic activity packs?</B> <FONT SIZE=-1> 
        <UL>
          Clic activity packs can be presented in two different formats: <B>"open"</B> 
          packs (have the PAC extension) and <B>"compacted"</B> packs (have the 
          PCC extension). The activity packs in open format can be modified directly 
          from inside Clic through the menu <B>Edit - Edit activity</B>, but the 
          compacted packs are protected and the modification can't be done directly. 
          <P> The majority of the activity packs found in the Clic corner are 
            distributed in compacted format (PCC), but can be converted into open 
            format (PAC) through the utility <B>ClicPac</B>, that can be installed 
            with Clic. 
          <P> The steps to follow to modify a PCC are:          
          <OL>
            <LI>Convert the PCC into a PAC through ClicPac. 
            <LI>Run Clic and, in the File-Open menu, search for the PAC file. 
            <LI>Modify the activities as desired. 
            <LI>Reconvert the PAC into a PCC to protect it. 
          </OL>
          <p> You will find more information in ClicPac's help and in Clic's <A HREF="download.htm#eng">user's

          <p> Juan Jos&eacute; Mateo Molina has found a shareware version of WISE

        <B>Some of the buttons in Clic 3.0 appear with a wrong image</B> <FONT SIZE=-1> 
        <UL>
          This error can appear sporadically with some <B>ATI</B> video cards. 
          The manufacturer recognizes that it's latest versions of the drivers 
          for Windows 95/99 are not 100% compatible with 16 bit applications (and 
          Clic is one of them!). As a consequence the manufacturer proposes the 
          installation of the version 5.11 (build 4.10.2330), which after the 
          trials we have managed to make, behaves well with Clic. 
          <p> In ATI's web the <A HREF="http://support.atitech.ca/infobase/2950.html" class="extern"><B>reasons 
            for this problem</B></A> are explained, and the <A HREF="http://support.atitech.ca/drivers/win95-16bit.html" class="extern"><B>version 
            5.11</B></A> of the drivers can be downloaded. </p>

        <B>Clicking on the "Fonts" button makes the program freeze</B> <FONT SIZE=-1> 
        <UL>
          This occurs when there is an exaggerated amount of font types installed 
          in the computer (more than 1000). Clic tries to prepare a list with 
          al the names and runs out of memory. The solution is simple: take out 
          of the folder <B>Windows\Fonts</B> the types that aren't used regularly 
          and copy them into a different place in case they become necessary in 
          the future. You'll see the applications running a lot quicker and smoother. 
          <p> <B>Warning:</B> when doing this clean-up of fonts you should never 
            touch the system fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, System...) 
            nor the font <B>Marlett</B>, which is the one used by Windows to draw 
            the buttons that appear on the corner of the windows. A good way of 
            doing this is to only move those fonts that have an installation date 
            posterior to the installation of Windows. </p>

        <UL>
          The WAV files inside Clic activities are compressed using the audio 
          MSADPCM. The Clic installer adds this codec when it is run from a Windows 
          3.x, but it won't do it for Windows 95 since it is supposed to be already 
          incorporated by default. If the W95 installation was incomplete it could 
          be that the codec wasn't installed. To correct this problem, follow 
          these steps: 
          <P> 
          <OL>
            <LI>Open the W95 <B>Control Panel</B>. 
            <LI>Double clic on the icon <B>Add/Remove Programs</B>. 
            <LI>Choose the <B>Windows Installation</B> icon. 
            <LI>Double clic on <B>Multimedia</B>. 
            <LI>Check the <B>Audio Compression</B> box, the program will ask for 
              the Windows 95 installation CD to add the codecs.

        <B>Can we avoid error messages from showing up when we are running a multimedia

        <UL>
          In computers that don't have sound cards you can deactivate the use 
          of the multimedia files modifying the file CLIC.INI, which is found 
          in the Clic directory. With Windows Notepad you need to change the lines 
          <B>sound</B>, <B>midi</B>, <B>wave</B> and <B>mci</B> to say <B>"=no"</B>. 
          The modifications will become active the next time you run the program. 
          <p> The versions 2.2 and later detects if the computer has an installed 
            sound card and, in case it doesn't, it disables the reproduction of 
            the multimedia files. </p>

          <p>Surely you have saved the images in BMP format, a "Windows RLE encoded" 
            sub-format, and the only sub-format recognized by Clic is "Windows 
            RGB encoded". Anyway, it is always better if you save your images

        <B>We've created a drawing with "Paint Brush" but Clic shows it too small 
        and in a corner</B> <FONT SIZE=-1> 
        <UL>
          When you create a new image PaintBrush prepares a surface of 640x480 
          pixels. Even though your drawing may occupy only a small portion of 
          the surface, PaintBrush will save the entire image. The solution is 
          to save only the portion of the drawing that you are interested in: 
          <P> 
          <LI>If you work with Windows 95 "Paint" you can adjust the image size 
            by dragging the lower right hand corner to the desired size. 
            <P> 
          <LI>In Windows 3.1 you can use the rectangle tool in PaintBrush to select 
            the valid zone in your drawing and then use the menu option <B>Edit 
            - Copy to...</B> to save only the selected area. On exiting PaintBrush 
            say NO; you don't want to save the entire drawing (It's enough with 
            the portion you have selected and saved previously).

        <B>The images appear with different colors!</B> <FONT SIZE=-1> 
        <UL>
          This problem occurs when you use many images which are 256 colors from 
          different palettes. For example, if in the same activity there is an 
          image with 256 grays and another with 256 tones of blue. you would need 
          to simultaneously show 512 colors. If Windows is set up to millions 
          of colors there won't be a problem, but if it is configured to 256 it's 
          impossible to have 512 colors on the screen. Some programs solve this 
          problem by drawing patterns instead of pure colors, but Clic doesn't 
          have this option. The result: the grays will look bluish or the blues 
          grayish, depending on which image is last therefore imposing it's palette. 
          <P> The solution: save all the images with a common palette. This can 
            be done from within PainShopPro, increasing the color depth (menu 
            <B>Color - Increase color depth - 16 million colors</B>) and then 
            lowering it again (<B>Color - Decrease color depth - 256 colors</B>) 
            choosing in this second step the option <B>Palette Standard</B> and 
            <B>Error diffusion</B>.
          <p> Another possibility that offers better results is to use the program 
            <B>Jasc Batch Master</B>, that you can find in our <A HREF="../rec/index.htm">page 
            of resources</A>, for calculating and applying the optimal palette 
            for all the images. The function to choose is <B>Apply fully optimized 
            palette</B>. It is recommendable to always select the box <B>Include 
            Windows Colors</B>. </p>
