[JClic](/jclic/) is formed by a set of computer applications that are used for carrying out different types of educational activities: puzzles, associations, text exercises, crosswords...

The activities are not usually used alone, but packed in projects. A project is formed by a set of activities and one or more sequences, which indicate the order in which they have to be shown.

The predecessor of JClic is [Clic](/clic3/), an application that  has been used by educators of different countries since 1992 as a tool for the creation of didactic activities for their students.

JClic runs on the Java platform, it's a free software project and works in different environments and operating systems.

More recently, the JClic.js project has made possible to use JClic activities in any web browser and on any device, including smartphones, tablets and Chromebooks, without the need of installing Java.

There are two ways to access the [library of JClic projects](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo) on the clicZone:

### Playing the activities in an HTML5 block

HTML5 blocks are objects embedded in a web page. The projects that are seen this way do not remain stored in the hard disk: JClic downloads it, uses it and finally deletes it.

HTML5 blocks can work in two different ways:

- __In compatibility mode__: The HTML5 block downloads the activities in a single file with extension ".jclic.zip". Then tries to decompress it in memory. In this modality it may happen that some activities are not seen correctly.

- __In real HTML5 mode__: This is the recommended option. The web browser will download the ingredients of the activities as needed. Most activities will look right. In order to publish JClic activities in this modality, you must use the function _"Export to SCORM and HTML5"_ of JClic Author.

### Installing the activities

JClic has a wizard which allows you to  download the activities and put them in the projects library of the computer. The library is created the first time JClic is started, or when you try to do the first installation of a project.
