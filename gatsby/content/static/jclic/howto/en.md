[JClic](/jclic/) is formed by a set of computer programs used to create different types of educational activities: puzzles, associations, text exercises, crosswords...

Activities are usually packed in _projects_. A project is formed by a set of activities and one or more sequences, which indicate the order in which they have to be shown.

JClic is free software that runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Once created, the activities can be exported to HTML5 so they can be used also on Android, iOS and Chrome OS.

### On-line vs. installed activities

There are two ways to use the activities of the [library of JClic projects](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo):

- __Playing the activities in an HTML5 block__<br/>HTML5 blocks are objects embedded in a web page. The activities do not remain stored on the user's computer: JClic downloads, uses and finally deletes all the needed components.

- __Installing the activities__<br/>JClic has a wizard which allows you to  download the activities and put them on your __local projects library__. This library is created the first time JClic is started, or when you try to perform a project installation for first time. The installed activities can be used without Internet connection.
