### Space for personal JClic projects

The aim of this space is to facilitate teachers the publication of their own JClic projects that are not available in the [main library of the clicZone](https://clic.xtec.cat/repo/).

This service is currently available to users of the Educational Telematic Network of Catalonia (XTEC). If you do not have an XTEC identifier and wish to use the service, send us a message at: clic@xtec.cat.

To publish a project, it must first be exported to the HTML5-SCORM format using an updated version of [JClic Author](https://clic.xtec.cat/en/jclic/download.htm).

The projects published in this space can be used as evaluable activities in Moodle, embedded in a blog or website, and also spread to social networks.

__IMPORTANT__: Each user is responsible for the content published in their personal projects space. It is important to always respect the copyright of graphics, text and sound files used in the activities. All projects are always public and shared by default with a [Creative Commons license of type by-nc-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
